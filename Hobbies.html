<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>Outside of school I spend the most time playing golf. Although I'm not great at it, I still have a lot of fun. In addition to golf I play video games on my computer and sometimes my xbox. Currently my favorite game is <span class="emphasized">Rainbow Six - Siege</span>.
</p>
<h2>Jobs</h2>
<p>Although it is technically a job, I work at an escape room and I consider it a hobby. My <a href="AboutMe.html">family</a> is obsessed with escape rooms, we have done over 80 together. My personal escape rate is <span class = "bolded">95%</span> which I am pretty proud of. I have also worked as a counselor at a couple robotics summer camps for kids. I used to compete in robotic competitions in middle school and highschool.
