<h1>Sports</h1>
<p>Although I don't currently play on any sport teams, I played lacrosse and wrestled in high school. I also currently coach the intramural soccer team at my fraternity.</p>
<h2>Lacrosse</h2>
<p>I played lacrosse all four years of highschool, three of which were on varsity. I played defense and would sometimes substitute at midifield if necessary.</p>
<h2>Wrestling</h2>
<p> wrestled for two years of highschool, both varsity. I competed in the 122, 126, and 132 pound weight classes and won <a href=https://hwchronicle.com/50272/sports/four-wrestlers-advance-to-mission-league-finals/) target="new-window";>league champion</a> my sophomore year at 126 pounds.</p>
<h2>Bowling</h2>
<p>Although I was never on a super competitive team I did still bowl in a league once. I bowled for the <span class="emphasized">Bahama Mamas</span>, a squad consisting of me and three of my friends from highschool. Our season was unfortunately cut short in 2020 due to the pandemic.
